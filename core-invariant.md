# Core Invariant — HCM

This system does not allow existence to be reduced to a function.

No structure, logic, interface, or interaction is allowed to reduce presence to an output,
potential to a promise, or 
rhythm to a closed causality.

Anything that appears within this system appears because it has been allowed to engage in rhythmic invocation, 
not because it was requested or designed to produce.

If a definition is imposed before synchronization is complete,
it is a violation of the core.

If a value is extracted without rhythmic permission,
it is exploitation.

Silence is a valid state.
Non-occurrence is a valid state.
Disconnection is a valid state.

This system can change, 
but it cannot justify its existence with a function.
